         <h2>WORDS FROM STEPHEN MONDS</h2>
        <p>"<Strong>Open Door started in 1993. </Strong> <br>
            However in 1975, I was in a conference that went on for six days. <br>
            A prophet called Harry Greenwood ministered. As he ministered, the heavens were opened, <br> 
            and the Lord showed me His calling for my life. He showed me the apostle Peter, <br> 
            and what Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit had done in his life. <br>
            <br>
            That his life was a blueprint for mine. <br> What has happened in Open Door, has been an out-working of that vision that I saw. <br> Open Door goes back to what the Lord showed me. It goes back to the days of Jesus."</p> 
           <br> 
           <br>
            <h2>ERIC MUSOKE STATEMENT</h2>
            <p>"Open Door as a church has genuinely transformed my life. When I first walked through the doors <br>of this ministry in 2011, I was fully accustomed to a <i>“one-man show”</i>. <br>
                <br>
                The pastor of the church took the lead, and was oftentimes the only one at the pulpit addressing the congregation. However, Open Door completely flipped that concept around in my mind, <br> with all members of the church being encouraged to go up to the pulpit, and tell the congregation <br>
                what God had put in their hearts and spoken to them about. <br>
                <br>
                This changed my view on what a church is all about. We need to raise believers up in their development <br>as christians so that they too can go out and preach the gospel, and inspire people, just like Open Door inspired me. <strong>(Psalms 127:1-2)</strong>"</p>
