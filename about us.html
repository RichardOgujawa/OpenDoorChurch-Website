         <h2>Key Areas of Ministry of Open Door:</h2>
<ol>
         <li>Open door church is a bible believing and living church in Dublin, Ireland.<br>
            It is a preaching and healing ministry, carrying the flame of the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus.<br> 
            (Joshua 1:8 Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, 
            so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.)</li>
<br>
           <li>We believe in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour, And as the one who baptised us in the Holy Spirit. <br>
            (Romans 10: 9-10 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, 
            you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith 
            and are saved.)</li>
<br>
            <li>We work with the help of the Holy Spirit to bring people to believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and saviour.</li>
        <br>
            <li>We teach them the word of God. (Colossians 1:28 - He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, 
            so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.)</li>
       <br>
            <li>We work with the help of the Holy Spirit to detect their spiritual gift.</li>
<br>
        <li>We help them to grow spiritually and release them to go and make more disciples in the name of Jesus.</li>
<br>
    <li>The body grows by the release of every member of the body. <br>(Ephesians 4:16 – From him the whole body, 
        joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.)</li>
  <br>
        <li>Prophetic ministry is part of who we are. <br>(1 Corinthians: 14:29 Two or three prophets should speak the others should weigh carefully what is said …) 
        and (1 Corinthians: 14:31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.)</li>
